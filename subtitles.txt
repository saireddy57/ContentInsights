object of meditation
now if you make nothingness as the
object
you will develop concentration
but the mind will not be purified
and when you have god your
mind starts purifying
and enriched by the qualities
of the object of your meditation
so you have to visualize the form of
god our mind
has the five senses in the subtle
form so the mind
sees ears taste touches
smells so we use the subtle
senses present in the mind sit with your
back straight
neck straight hands on the knees
or in the lap wherever comfortable
